        "text": "The error message \"SyntaxError: Unexpected token '?'\" in your code is pointing to the use of \"??=\". This operator is called the \"nullish coalescing operator\" and it's used to provide a default value when a variable is either `null` or `undefined`.\n\nThe problem is that this operator might not be supported in the JavaScript environment you are using. Older versions of Node.js or certain browsers might not recognize it. \n\n**Here's how to fix it:**\n\n1. **Check Your Environment:**  Make sure you are using a recent version of Node.js that supports the nullish coalescing operator (Node.js version 14 or later).\n\n2. **Use a Default Value Check:** If you need to support older environments, you can rewrite the code using a conditional statement to check for `null` or `undefined`:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const listeners = (obj.Klistener !== null && obj.Klistener !== undefined) ? obj.Klistener : [];\n   ```\n\n   This code checks if `obj.Klistener` is not `null` and not `undefined`. If it is neither, it uses the value of `obj.Klistener`. Otherwise, it assigns an empty array (`[]`) to the `listeners` variable.\n\n3. **Babel/Webpack:** If you're using a build process with Babel or Webpack, ensure that your configuration is set up to transpile your code to a JavaScript version that your target environment supports.\n\nBy making these changes, you can fix the syntax error and ensure your code runs correctly. \n"
